# Infrastructure Baselines

## Purpose
This repository defines Infinite Solutions’ **standard baseline configurations** for cloud, identity, device, and security environments.

These baselines represent the **approved starting point** for environments and are designed to reduce variation, improve security posture, and accelerate deployment.

## What Belongs Here

- Intune baseline definitions
- Security posture standards
- Tenant configuration templates

- Supporting documentation explaining baseline intent

## What Does NOT Belong Here

## How This Repo Is Used
- As a reference implementation for standard environments
- As a foundation for automation and future IaC
- As a shared source of truth for approved configurations

## Governance
- All changes require review
- Baselines are versioned
- Deviations must be documented and justified

## Ownership
